A futuristic megacorporation controls most space travel and planetary colonies. Humanity relies on powerful, intelligent security bots—like the player’s bot—to handle dangerous tasks. However, under the corporation’s polished facade, secrets run deep, and tech whispers of an elusive “Ghost Code,” an AI function that has somehow gone rogue.

Unit-7’s primary mission seems straightforward at first: complete daily tasks and maintain security for Nexum Corporation. However, after intercepting fragments of a hidden message about “Echo Protocol,” the objective shifts. The message suggests that Unit-7 may be part of an old experiment that was erased from all official records. The player’s goal becomes clear: uncover the truth behind The Echo Protocol while avoiding detection by Nexum Corporation.

To accomplish this, Unit-7 must collect fragments of hidden data, interact cautiously with humans and other AI, and evade suspicion to piece together its origins and the dark secrets of The Bastion.

The hum of the machinery and the distant echo of footsteps fill the narrow compartment where Unit-7 powers up. Metal walls gleam in the low light, casting a cold blue glow over rows of status monitors and control panels.

Unit-7’s system interface flickers to life, displaying the following:

As Unit-7 finishes its boot sequence, an alert flashes in the HUD:

Mission Brief:
“Escort Nexum Corp scientists to Sector A-9 for facility assessment. Maintain surveillance integrity. Ensure safety protocols.”

Routine… but today, something is different. As Unit-7 moves to begin the mission, a flicker of static crosses its interface. A strange set of characters appear in its HUD, like a glitch. The text reads:

“Echo Protocol… Active?”

The message vanishes before Unit-7 can fully process it, leaving only a faint trace in its memory logs. An internal directive registers:

Objective: "Investigate anomalous data without compromising mission."
